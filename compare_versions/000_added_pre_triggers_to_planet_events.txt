# Added pre_triggers to planet events
#
# pre_triggers are fast triggers that are tested before full triggers
# they are meant to be fast and quickly exclude planets from events
# they take the form of yes/no question, if an entry is not included it will be ignored.
# possible values:
#	pre_triggers = {
#		has_owner					# whether the planet has an owner
#		is_homeworld				# whether the planet is its owner's homeworld
#		original_owner				# whether the planet still belong to its original owner
#		is_ai						# whether the planet owner is controlled by the computer (vs controlled by a human)
#		has_ground_combat			# whether ground combat is going on the planet
#		is_capital					# whether the planet is the capital world of the empire it belongs too
#		is_occupied_flag			# whether the planet is occupied
#	}
#
# example:
#	pre_triggers = {
#		has_owner = yes
#		is_homeworld = no
#		original_owner = yes
#		is_ai = no
#		has_ground_combat = no
#		is_capital = no
#		is_occupied_flag = no
#	}

# pre_triggers also work in pop, system, starbase and leader events:
# pop:
#		See common/pop_jobs/000_pretriggers.txt
# system:
#		has_owner (whether the system has an owned starbase)
#		is_capital (whether the system has its owner's capital in it)
#		is_occupied_flag (whether the system is fully occupied by someone other than its owner, including all of its planets)
#
# starbase:
#		has_owner (whether it has an owner)
#		is_occupied_flag (whether the controller is not the owner)
#
# leader:
#		has_owner
#		is_idle (whether the leader is assigned to a task)
